    <h1>Sophia Ling's Project Proposal!</h1>
    <div class="header">
      <h2>Project Concept/Motivation:</h2>
      <p>
        I want to build a smart trash can that only opens for humans and prevents pets (like my 
        Japanese Akita) from accessing it. Regular trash cans can easily be broken into by pets 
        like my large dog, leading to messes. This system will use motion, height detection, 
        and hand proximity sensing to ensure that only a human can open it.
      </p>

      <h2>Anticipated Bill of Materials</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>PIR Motion Sensor (detects movement)</li>
        <li>Ultrasonic Sensor (measures height to distinguish humans vs pets)</li>
        <li>IR Proximity Sensor (detects hand near the lid for final verification)</li>
        <li>Servo Motor (opens the lid)</li>
        <li>Assorted resistors (for current-limiting)</li>
        <li>Jumper wires (for connections)</li>
        <li>Modified trash bin lid & small trash can or cardboard for building own trash can</li>
        <li>Batteries (for portability)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Timeline and contingency plans:</h2>
      <p>Week 1 - gather components and test individual sensors, write and test basic Arduino 
        code to open lid when motion & height are detected, integrate IR sensor
    </p>
    <p>Week 2 - Assemble components into functional prototype inside trash can, fine-tune sensor 
        thresholds, final testing â€“ potentially add green/red LEDs
    </p>
    <p>
        If IR sensor fails, simplify to just height + motion
