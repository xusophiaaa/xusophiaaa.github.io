    <h2>Project Concept/Motivation:</h2>
    <p>
        For my final project, I designed and built a smart trash can that automatically opens and closes 
        when a user waves their hand in front of it. The initial concept was based around the idea of 
        creating a "pet-resistant" trash can to prevent pets from accessing the contents by detecting 
        height. However, after considering that my dog could easily tear apart the trashcan 
        itself, I shifted my focus to a more practical and user-friendly solution: an automated 
        trash can that responds to hand gestures. 
        When I explored the possibility of using an ultrasonic sensor to measure height, I found that 
        this was challenging without mounting the sensor in a fixed place above the object being measured. 
        Ultimately, I decided to use the ultrasonic sensor to detect proximity, triggering the trash can 
        when it senses movement within a certain distance.

      <h2>Circuit Schematic</h2>

      <p>
        The circuit schematic for the smart trash can. The schematic illustrates how the PIR motion 
        sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and servo motor are connected to the Arduino.
      </p>
      <h2>Bill of Materials</h2>
      To build the smart trash can, I used the following components and materials:
      <ul>
        <li>PIR Motion Sensor (detects movement near the trash can)</li>
        <li>Ultrasonic Sensor (measures distance)</li>
        <li>Servo Motor (controls the opening and closing of the lid)</li>
        <li>Popsicle stick (scavenged from the Mill trash, used to extend servo motor arm)</li>
        <li>Cardboard (scavenged from my apartment's trash room to construct trash can body)</li>
        <li>Arduino and Breadboard</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Circuit Setup</h2>
      <img src="doc1.jpg"/>
      <img src="doc2.jpg"/>
      <p> 
        The circuitry for my project are housed in a separate compartment at the back of my trash can. 
        The motion sensor, servo motor, and ultrasonic sensor are connected to the Arduino via wiring
         passes through a small hole in the cardboard wall are concealed and protected with cardboard 
         casing.
      </p>

      <h2>Firmware & Technical Implementation</h2>
      <p>The PIR motion sensor detects movment near the trash can. After it senses movement, the 
        ultrasonic sensor measures the distance of an object (e.g., a hand) from the trash can.
      </p>
      <p>The Arduino process input from the sensors and triggers the servo motor accordingly. The 
        code includes a 3-second delay after closing to ensure smooth operation.
      </p>
      <p>The trash can body and lid were constructed using cardboard and popsicle sticks, with a 
        separate compartment for housing the electronics.
      </p>

      <pre><code>
#include <Servo.h>
Servo lidServo;  // Create a servo object
const int trigPin = 10;  // Ultrasonic sensor pins
const int echoPin = 11;
const int pirPin = 2;  // PIR motion sensor pin
int pos = 0;  // Servo position

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    lidServo.attach(9);  // Servo to pin 9
    pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
    pinMode(pirPin, INPUT);
    lidServo.write(0);  // Start with the lid closed
}

void loop() {
    // Check PIR sensor for motion
    if (digitalRead(pirPin) == HIGH) {
    Serial.println("Motion detected!");
    
    // Measure distance using ultrasonic sensor
    long duration, distance;
    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
    delayMicroseconds(2);
    digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(10);
    digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
    duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);
    distance = (duration / 2) / 29.1;  // Convert to cm

    Serial.print("Distance: ");
    Serial.println(distance);

    // If object is within 10cm, open the lid
    if (distance < 10) {
        lidServo.write(90);  // Open lid
        Serial.println("Lid opened");
        delay(3000);  // Keep lid open for 3 seconds
        lidServo.write(0);  // Close lid
        Serial.println("Lid closed)");
        delay(3000); // delay for 3 seconds so that trash can won't keep opening and closing
    }
    } else {
    Serial.println("No motion detected.");
    }
    delay(100);  // Small delay to stabilize readings
}
      </code></pre>
     
      <h2>Project in Action!</h2>
      <img src="docgif.gif" /> 
      <p>
        The trash can automatically opens when it detects movement 0-10 cm away and will close 
        after 3 seconds. There's also a 3 second delay after the trash can closes so that it won't 
        rapidly open and close.
      </p>
