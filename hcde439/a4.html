      <h2>Fig 1: Circuit Schematic</h2>
      <img src="librariesschem.jpg"/>
      <p>
        This schematic demonstrates how I set up my servo motor and capacitative touch sensor.
        I used a 1 megohm resistor between pins 4 and 2 because its high resistance limits the current drawn from 
        the Arduino pin, which helps prevent potential damage from large voltage fluctuations. The 1 megohm resistor 
        also makes it so that absolute touch is required to activate it.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I used a 100 uF capacitator with the servo motor to stabilize the voltage spikes that occur when the 
        servo draws a large current during startup. A 100 uF capacitator was used from the recommendation of  
        Arduino Docs "Servo Motor Basics with Arduino" article.
      </p>

      <h2>Fig 2: Circuit Setup</h2>
      <img src="librariessetup.jpg"/>
      <p> 
        The servo motor is attached to pin 9 while the capacitative touch sensor utilizes pins 2 (senses a change) 
        and 4 (sends electrical energy). I used my house key as the touch sensor.
      </p>

      <h2>Fig 3: Input Output GIF</h2>
      <img src="librariesgif.gif" /> 
      <p>
        In this video, I'm demonstrating how the servo motor only moves when I am making contact when I am 
        making contact with the key, making 180 degree sweeps back and forth. When I stop touching the key, 
        the motor immediately stops.
      </p>

      <h2>Firmware</h2>
      <pre><code>

                }
            }
        
            myservo.write(pos);  // move servo to the updated position
            delay(15);  // small delay to control speed of movement
            }
            // if the sensor is not touched, the servo holds its last position
        }

      <h2>Additional Questions:</h2>
      <h3>1. Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:
        for (int i=0, i<180, i++){servo.write(i); delay(100);}. </h3> 
        <h3>
        Draw a graph with the X axis in seconds, for two seconds, 
        and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.</h3>
      <img src="librariesq1.jpg" /> 
      <p>
        The pulse width of a servo motor is around 1-1.5 ms which is why the peaks appear so narrow. During those ~1 ms 
        periods, the voltage goes up to 5V.
        There is a peak every 20 ms because the servo signal has a 20 ms period, for a total of 100 peaks 
        in a 2 second time period.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Your input device is slightly broken, leading it to give us an erroneous reading 1% of the time. 
        How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
      </h3>
      <p>
        This solution sets an appropriate error range and disregards values that fall out of that 
        range in relation to the average of the last 5 sensor values.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        initialize queue with max size = 5
        % error = okay error range

        function findOutliers():
            new_val = readSensor() // read sensor value
            add new_val to queue 

            if queue size > 10:
                remove oldest value
            
            avg = avg of values in queue // get average of last 5 readings
            
            // if sensor value is outside of error range, return averaged value
            if abs(new_val - avg_val) > error: 
                return avg 
            // otherwise return sensor value
            else:
                return new_val
      </code></pre>
      
      <h3>3. Your input device is slightly noisy, leading the measurement to randomly deviate from the true measurement up or down by 10%. 
        How can we address this? Answer in (pseudo)code.
      </h3> 
      <p>
        This solution averages 5 values at a time which smooths out the random deviations of 10%.
      </p>
      <pre><code>
        initialize queue with max size = 5
        function movingAverage():
            new_val = readSensor() // read sensor value
            add new_val to queue
            
            if queue size > 5:
                remove oldest value (FIFO) // keep only last 5 values
            
                return average(queue) // return average of last 5 values
