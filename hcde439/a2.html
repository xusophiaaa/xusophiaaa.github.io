      <h2>Fig 1a & 1b: Circuit Schematic and Calculations</h2>
      <img src="fadeschem.jpg"/>
      <p>This schematic depicts my set up of 2 red LEDs, 1 RBG LED, and a button.</p>
      <img src="fadecalc.jpg"/>
      <p>I used 220Ohm resistors with red LEDs and a 100Ohm resistor with the blue LED (although 220 would work fine too). I used a 10KOhm resistor with the button.</p>
      <h2>Fig 2: Circuit Setup</h2>
      <img src="fadesetup.jpg"/>
      <p>I used 6 digital pins in order to individually control each LED and the button.</p>
      <h2>Firmware</h2>
      <pre><code>
        const int button = 2; // Button pin
        const int red = 6; // Red LED pin
        const int blue = 3; // Blue LED pin
        const int green = 5; // Green LED pin
        
        void setup() {
          pinMode(10, OUTPUT); // Set pin 10 as output
          pinMode(11, OUTPUT); // Set pin 11 as output
          pinMode(red, OUTPUT); // Set red LED pin as output
          pinMode(blue, OUTPUT); // Set blue LED pin as output
          pinMode(green, OUTPUT); // Set green LED pin as output
          pinMode(button, INPUT); // Set button pin as input
        }
        
        void loop() {
          if (digitalRead(button) == HIGH) { // Check if button is pressed
            digitalWrite(10, HIGH); // Turn off pin 10
            digitalWrite(11, HIGH); // Turn on pin 11
            digitalWrite(red, HIGH); // Turn on red LED
            digitalWrite(blue, LOW); // Turn off blue LED
            digitalWrite(green, LOW); // Turn off green LED
          } else {
            digitalWrite(10, LOW);
            for (int i = 0; i < 255; i += 50) { // Loop with step of 50
              analogWrite(11, i); // Fade pin 11 up
              delay(100); // Wait 100ms
              analogWrite(11, 255 - i); // Fade pin 11 down
              delay(100); // Wait 100ms
              rainbow(i); // Call rainbow function
            }
          }
        }
        
        void rainbow(int i) {
          analogWrite(red, 255 - i); // Adjust red brightness
          analogWrite(green, i); // Adjust green brightness
          analogWrite(blue, 0); // Turn off blue
          delay(50); // Wait 50ms
          analogWrite(red, 0); // Turn off red
          analogWrite(green, 255 - i); // Adjust green brightness
          analogWrite(blue, i); // Adjust blue brightness
          delay(50); // Wait 50ms
          analogWrite(red, i); // Adjust red brightness
          analogWrite(green, 0); // Turn off green
          analogWrite(blue, 255 - i); // Adjust blue brightness
          delay(50); // Wait 50ms
        }
      </code></pre>
      <p>My code controls LEDs based on a button press. When I press the button, it turns on all the red LEDs. If I donâ€™t press the button, the LEDs fade in and out pin 11 and the RGB LED cycles through 
        different colors in a "rainbow" effect using the rainbow() function. The loop handles both the button behavior and the LED animations.</p>
      <h2>Fig 3: Fade GIF</h2>
      <img src="fadegif.gif" /> 
      <p>When the button is not pressed, the RGB led will fade between colors and one of the red LEDs will fade on and off. When
         the button is pressed, all the LEDs will light up as a solid red.
      </p>
      <h2>Additional Questions:</h2>
      <h2>Fig 4: Time vs Voltage Chart</h2>
      <img src="fadechart.jpg"/> 
      <p>This chart depicts 3 lines representing the voltage across and LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), 
        and analogWrite(led, 255). The X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. The analogWrite() method sets the value of a PWM output 
        pin and is on a scale of 0-255, such that analogWrite(255) requests a 100% duty cycle (always on) and analogWrite(128) is a 50% duty
         cycle (on half the time). It creates the appearance of a dimmer light by turning on and off so fast that our eyes register it 
         as dimmer. </p> 
         <p>One cycle is 2 milliseconds long (according to the Arduino website). So, analogWrite(led, 128) would have a pulse width of 2ms/(255/164) = 1ms, 
          and analogWrite(led, 64) would have a pulsewidth of 2ms/(255/64) = 0.5ms. 
         </p> 
      <h2>Fig 5: Question 2 Calculations</h2>
      <img src="fadeq2.jpg"/>
      <p> Given my schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is my LEDs, my circuit would run for approximately
         16 hours if powered by a 1200 mAh battery.
